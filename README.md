# Frontend Developer Test

Please fork this repository to begin your front end developer test, then download your repository and follow the installation instructions.

# Installation
Installation requires node.js on your computer

npm install

node server.js

# Instructions
There should now be a web server running at http://localhost:8888
Follow the instructions displayed on that webpage.

The node server provides everything you need for the back end of the test. You are welcome to look at the server code, but you should not need to modify anything to make your front end work. All of your code should be placed in the public directory in this project. The node server will act as the web server for your front end application.

Please insure that your code runs properly with the node server. Test all the features and make sure that no Javascript errors are generated.

Thank you
